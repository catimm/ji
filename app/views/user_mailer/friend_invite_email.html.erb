        <h4 class="paragraphSpace">I hope all is well! I'm reaching out to ask if you'd be willing to help a friend of 
        	mine. They are in the early phases of exploring an idea for a new business related to <%= @description %> and 
        	would really like to hear your thoughts on a few related questions.  It should take ~<%= @time %> minutes of 
        	your time.</h4>
        <h4 class="paragraphSpace">My friend is using an online service called <%= link_to "bonu", root_url %>
        	to gather input. Hopefully this approach takes up less of your time and gives you a little flexibility to 
        	provide answers when it works best for you....Though if you're willing and wouldn't mind doing it in the 
        	next week or so, that would be the most helpful.</h4>
        <h4>So, if you're willing to help out, <%= link_to "follow this link", @link %> to get started.</h4>

    <div class="sectionSpace">
        <h4>Thanks for considering. I know my friend really appreciates it,</h4>
        <h4 class="paragraphSpace"><%= @inviter.first_name %></h4>
        <h4>PS - There's an option at the end to invite a few of your friends to provide input. So if you finish and 
        	think of anyone else who might be interested, please pass it along. Thanks again!</h4>
